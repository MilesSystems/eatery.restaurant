1.	 Introduction and Context
  The purpose of this system is to integrate software and hardware technology into a restaurant to facilitate information sharing between all restaurant staff and allow customers to order food, pay, and directly communicate with the wait staff.  

	Currently customers order food directly from their wait staff.  The wait staff must write down a customers order and produce a copy for the kitchen to in turn prepare the food.   This process is time consuming and prone to errors.  The wait staff must also take care of all customers needs, including being aware of refills, handling payments, and other miscellaneous needs of each customer.
	The proposed system will consist of 4 components, a customer component, wait staff component, kitchen component, and a component for the manager.  The 4 components will enable information sharing of customer orders, specific customer needs, facilitate and track payments, allow management to monitor wait staff performance and customer transactions, and improve customer service and satisfaction.


2.	  Users and Their Goals

The users of this system are restaurant customers and all staff of a restaurant including waiters, kitchen staff, and managers.  They are not required to have more than a minimal understanding of computers.  The goal is to integrate hardware and software into a restaurant to enable direct involvement of the customers in ordering, communicating, and paying for food along with improving the flow of information between restaurant staff and recording transactions.
